# H2O-Insights
This Java project done with peers Shubho Mukherjee and Finnley Howald aims to analyze and present statistics related to a test conducted on different types of people regarding their preferences for bottled or tap water.

The program outputs the total statistics for how many types of people participated in the test as well as the total answers for questions pertaining to choosing bottled or tap water. The next part is the user can input a number from 1 - 50 to get a individual student's answers to each question. The last portion is the final statistics for which type of people prefer bottled or tap water before and after the test, as well as which type of water they think is more environmentally friendly to obtain.
